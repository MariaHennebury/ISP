Newfoundland and Labrador's healthcare landscape is undergoing significant shifts, marked by rising morbidity rates, prolonged hospital stays, and potential workforce challenges. This proposal seeks to employ machine learning techniques to analyze datasets encompassing hospital morbidity, occupation projections, deaths by ages, and hospital bed utilization. By uncovering correlations between healthcare trends and workforce dynamics, this research aims to inform strategic interventions for optimizing healthcare delivery and ensuring long-term sustainability.

Morbidity Trends: Are there discernible patterns indicating a rise in morbidity rates within Newfoundland and Labrador? If so, what are the key factors contributing to this trend?

Hospital Utilization: Is there evidence to suggest an increase in the duration of hospital stays among patients? What factors may be influencing this phenomenon, and how does it correlate with morbidity patterns?

Workforce Dynamics: What insights can be gleaned from detailed occupation projections regarding the healthcare workforce in Newfoundland and Labrador? Are there indications of a shrinking healthcare workforce, and if so, what are the potential ramifications?

Interrelationships: How do morbidity trends, hospital utilization patterns, and workforce dynamics interact within the healthcare ecosystem? Are there feedback loops or causal chains that exacerbate or mitigate the observed trends?
