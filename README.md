Predicting Hospital Stay Duration in Newfoundland and Labrador


Newfoundland and Labrador faces challenges in healthcare delivery, including rising morbidity rates and potentially prolonged hospital stays. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the duration of hospital stays for patients based on various contributing factors. By understanding these predictors, healthcare providers can better allocate resources and optimize patient care.

Datasets I will use
     - Hospital Morbidity in NL
     - Deaths by ages
     - Hospital Beds Staffed and In Operation
     - Health Workforce data for NL (specific to nurses as I am one)
